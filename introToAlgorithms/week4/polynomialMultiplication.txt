Polynomial multiplication is taking two polynomials and multiplying them together.

  A monomial is 5x, 8, -8.
  A polynomial is a combo monomial. 7 + 5xy + 3x-8
  A term is just the monomials. (ex: 7, 5xy, 3x, -8)
  If you have a variable in the denominator, it is not a polynomial  (6/x)

Use cases for multiplying polynomials:
   - Error-correcting codes
   - Large integer multiplication
   - Generating functions

Coefficient is the leading number in a polynomial

(3, 2, 5) * (5, 1, 2)
(3x^2 + 2x + 5) * (5x^2 + x + 2)
Multiply them and you will get:
13x^3 + 36x^2 + 9x + 10
