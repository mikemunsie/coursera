A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each state with the hope of finding a global best outcome.

- Start with a safe move.
- Prove the safe move.
- Solve subproblem.
- Estimate running time.

Greedy Strategy: Start with a list of digits, find the max, and remove it from the list. Repeat until there are no digits in the list.

Car Fueling:
Full tank = 400km

Subproblem: Similar of problem of smaller size
ex:
Largest Number:
What is the largest number that consists of digits 3,9,5,9,7,1?
9
What is the largest number that consists of digits 3,5,9,7,1?
9
What is the largest number that consists of digits 3,5,7,1?
7
...

Make a greedy choice, prove that it is a safe move.

Ex: Grouping children with ages no more than 1 year apart: 3.6, 4, 4.8, 5

When solving an algorithm, reformulate the problem into mathematical terms.
