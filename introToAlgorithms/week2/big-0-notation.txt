Review a previous algorithm:
  Function FibList(n)
    create an array F[0...n]
    F[0] <- 0
    F[1] <- 1
    for i from 2 to n:
      F[i] < F[i-1] + F[i-2]
    return F[n]

- This is 2n + 2 lines of code.  This is not the running time of the algorithm.
- Figuring out accurate runtimes is a huge mess.
- We want to be able to measure runtime without knowing all the things behind the scenes (The compiler, computer used, memory, etc.)
