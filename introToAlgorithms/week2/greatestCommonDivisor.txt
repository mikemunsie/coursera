- What is the largest number the numerator and denominator can be divided by.
- Divide numerator and demoninator by d
  a/d / b/d
  We want d to be as large as possible. W
- Ex: 4/10 => 2
- Ex: 10/10 => 10

Compute GCD
  Input: Integers a,b > 0
  Output: gcd(a,b)

- Naive algorithm: An algorithm that works, but not optimized
